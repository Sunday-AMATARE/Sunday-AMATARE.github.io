I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Engineering at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, The University of Texas at Arlington. My doctoral journey began in Fall 2023. I am also a member of Transformative Wireless Systems and Technology (TWiST) Lab under the supervision of Professor [Debashri Roy](https://twistlab.uta.edu/about-pi/). Before embarking on my PhD, I earned my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Computer Science from the University of Ilorin and the University of Ibadan, respectively.
